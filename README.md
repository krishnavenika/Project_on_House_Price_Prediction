### Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Examined the distribution of house prices and explored relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Identified potential correlations and patterns within the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Utilized regression algorithms to train predictive models on the dataset.
   - Experimented with different algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting Regression.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the performance of each model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the primary metric.
   - Determined the best performing model based on its ability to accurately predict house prices.

### Results

- **Initial Model (Linear Regression)**:
  - RMSE: 96,427.43

- **Gradient Boosting Regression Model**:
  - RMSE: 84,577.33

The Gradient Boosting Regression model outperformed the initial linear regression model, demonstrating its superior predictive capabilities in estimating house prices.
